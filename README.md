# Convolutional Deep Neural Network for Digit Classification

## AIM

To Develop a convolutional deep neural network for digit classification and to verify the response for scanned handwritten images.

## Problem Statement and Dataset
Digit classification and to verify the response for scanned handwritten images.

The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits. The task is to classify a given image of a handwritten digit into one of 10 classes representing integer values from 0 to 9, inclusively. The dataset has a collection of 60,000 handwrittend digits of size 28 X 28. Here we build a convolutional neural network model that is able to classify to it's appropriate numerical value.
